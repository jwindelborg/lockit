# Lockit - A small random lock screen program

It is quite simple. Every lock command goes in lock_commands.

Only dependency as it is now is i3lock.

Some of the scripts are borrowed from around the internet:
* i3lock-fancy it is borrowed from here [meskarune/i3lock-fancy](https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy) there is made some minor adjustments.
* pixi.sh is borrowed from reddit: [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/35m141/i3lock_why_blur_the_beauty/cr62uj0/?st=iztje8qy&sh=54eb5f1e) thanks to user [/u/3lvewyn ](https://reddit.com/u/3lvewyn)
* xkcd.sh is borrowed from [angs/xkcd-lock](https://github.com/angs/xkcd-lock)
