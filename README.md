# Lockit - A small random lock screen program

It is quite simple. Every lock command goes in lock_commands.

Only dependency as it is now is i3lock.

One of the scripts is i3lock-fancy it is borrowed from here [meskarune/i3lock-fancy](https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy)

Another script is borrowed from reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/35m141/i3lock_why_blur_the_beauty/cr62uj0/?st=iztje8qy&sh=54eb5f1e](r/unixporn) thanks to user [/u/3lvewyn](https://reddit.com/u/3lvewyn)
